# Chamma Bank

This is a simulation of a bank account and how it works with transfers, adding money, and withdrawing money.

## Installation


```bash
pip install custometkinter
pip install tk
```
# Please run the runme.py file
## Usage
When running this application you will be presented with a GUI interface for entering the username and password.

I would use: username: htk password: 123
other wise all the accounts are present in the data.json file. 

be careful if you messup the username and password 3 time you will need to restart the application since it will not allow you to continue

After that it will give you your user account where you will be able to make transferring money adding money, and withdrawing money

## Adding Money

To add money you need to input a number from 0-2000 at a time

## Transferring Money

1. Enough money should be in the account
2. Will need another users account number which can be found in the data.json file under "accountNumber" 
3. Do not mess up a transfer 3 times otherwise you will have to rerun the app
4. Please look at your console to check if transfer is invalid

## Withdraw Money

1. Enough money should be in account
2. It takes money out of the account
